Palo Alto Networks firewalls are the gold standard for enterprise security, offering advanced threat prevention, but managing them manually often means endless hours of policy configurations, error-prone processes, and the constant struggle to maintain consistency across deployments.
Two seasoned cybersecurity experts who know the struggles first hand and have deep insights from their time at Palo Alto Networks wrote this book to show you how to transform frustrating manual processes into a streamlined, automated solutions using a code-driven approach that bridges the gap between powerful technology and efficient implementation.
From Next-Generation Firewall fundamentals to designing robust security policies and automating them using Python, you’ll find everything you need in one place. While most other resources focus on theory or vendor documentation, this book delivers a hands-on guide packed with best practices and automation strategies. You'll learn how to integrate security policies with IT workflows, leverage automation frameworks like PAN-OS SDKs, and apply Infrastructure-as-Code techniques for efficient deployments.
By the end of this Palo Alto book, you’ll have the skills to optimize security configurations, improve compliance, and use Python-driven automation to manage policies at scale.</details>
